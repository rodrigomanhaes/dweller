= dweller

Information about places: countries, states, cities etc.

Currently, at a very initial stage. Suggestions are welcome.

By now, only Brazil is supported.

Usage (yes, must be improved):

    class Country; include Dweller::Country; end
    
    rio = Country.load_country('brazil').state('RJ').
    campos = rio.city('Campos dos Goytacazes')
